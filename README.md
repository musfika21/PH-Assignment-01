## 📖 Overview

This project — **Bangladesh 2.0** — was one of my very first web development assignments when I started learning **HTML** and **CSS**.  
It’s a simple one-page website that represents the vision, innovation, and challenges of a modern and progressive Bangladesh.

The website includes multiple sections such as:
- Hero / Banner section  
- Four pillars of development  
- Vision and mission statement  
- Recent news  
- Donation / Call to Action  
- Newsletter subscription  
- Footer with social links

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – for the structure of the page  
- **CSS3** – for styling and layout  
- **Flexbox** – for positioning and alignment  
- **GitHub Pages** – for hosting the live site
